\section{Ethics}

It goes without saying that traffic anonymization is notoriously hard. Though an effective proof of concept, feature extraction by itself is insufficient to truly protect the users' privacy (which, seeing as the main use case for this model is to defend corporate networks, is obviously mandatory). Thus, more research is needed to reduce the risk: \textbf{how best can we partially redact the pcap data before any other processing in order to protect workers without too much of a cost to model effectiveness?}
