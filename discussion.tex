In this section, we will discuss avenues for further research.

\subsection{The many forms of diversity}

    The data we have collected seems to indicate that augmenting with shared data is more effective the further apart the individual datasets are. This makes intuitive sense: the more diverse the immune systems, the more ground they can cover and thus the less overextension the model will be forced to do. However, we are left with only a vague sense of \textit{how} diverse is optimal. (A dataset comprised exclusively of extreme points may be \textit{better} than one comprised exclusively of more central points, but it will still be inaccurate closer to the center.) Further research is required to elucidate \textbf{what protocol results in optimal data sharing.}
